# Sam Stikeleather Challenge 1

## Cleaning up and modifying the "Horiseon" Home Page

# It was found that it in the CSS and HTML there were many redundancies in both that could be consolidated and cleaned up to provide a more legible sequence of code. Upon being cleaned up it would be easier for anyone reading either of the aforementioned sheets to clean up and further improve the page if it was made less redundant.

# Upon cleaning up and eliminating several redudancies in the CSS it was noticed that there was no clear title for the page or ALT tags for the images. After adding those I found things to be more accessible to screen readers. 

# These changes have made the webpage itself more accessible for screen readers and viewers alike, but also has made the HTML and CSS more accesible for anyone working on the backend of the page. 

# I learned that in some minor consolidations it can improve the legibility and overall length of a CSS document drastically. I consolidated nearly 56 lines of code total on the CSS alone. 

# I believe this project will stand out because it allows the original work to still show through while having some albeit minor changes that do drastically improve the page.
